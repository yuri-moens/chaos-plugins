# Chaos Plugins

These are OSRS plugins to be used with the [unethicalite](https://github.com/unethicalite/unethicalite) client. Some of
them completey automate stuff, others simply enhance your gameplay by making things easier. Some work ok, others are janky
and some might not work entirely. I do not offer support on these. Issues may or may not be looked at. Specific plugin 
readmes are found in the plugin directories. All plugins are created with the idea of using packets for interacting.
Mouse events/invokes are too slow and will make most plugins fail horribly.
