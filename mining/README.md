# Mining

This plugin mines and optionally banks for you. Currently supports:

* Quarry sandstone (3 tick, deposit in grinder)
* Quarry granite (3 tick, drop only)

Some locations, like quarry granite, do not support banking and will always drop materials, regardless of the `Drop`
configuration option.
