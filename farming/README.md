# Farming

This plugin does herb runs for you. It's currently tailored to my needs so there's a few requisites.

* Falador, Ardougne: does not check teleport item charges, you can turn the usage off manually
* Hosidius: Xeric's talisman is not currently supported, requires your house to be in Hosidius
* Farming guild: Skill's necklace only, no fairy rings support
* Troll Stronghold, Weiss, Harmony Island: requires **portal** in your house (Nexus currently not supported)
* Only works with bottomless compost bucket

## Seed modes

* Lowest first: withdraw the lowest quality herb seeds first
* Highest first: withdraw the highest quality herb seeds first
* Lowest first, highest on disease free: withdraw the lowest quality herb seeds first but use the highest ones on disease free patches
* ... per two: these options take a maximum of 2 seeds per type, this is useful if you have a herb sack so we can store 
everything in it without having to note herbs
* Manual: currently unsupported
