# Tempoross

This plugin plays the Tempoross minigame for you. It only supports solo runs and gets slightly over 8,000 points in
under 10 minutes around level 75 with a Dragon harpoon. Just start near the boat in Unkah with all the necessary
equipment:

* at least 4 buckets
* a hammer
* a rope or Spirit angler outfit
* a harpoon unless you use Barbarian fishing

Currently supports normal, Dragon and Infernal harpoons. Crystal is **not** supported.
